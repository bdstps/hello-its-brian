Do you ever just stop and think about the fact that at any given moment there are literal billions of people doing things. To quantify it a little more concretely, 100% of people are doing things at all times. I don’t know. It’s just something I think about a lot, especially when I am having particular difficulties doing things.

In fact, I very nearly chose not to do this this year. I couldn’t tell you why, other than “I just didn’t feel like it.” But I’ll try to explain it anyway.

It’s like this weird double feeling of “everything happened this year, and I couldn’t possibly condense it into something interesting,” and also “I literally just sat in this spot for a majority of the last year, how could I tell a worthwhile story?”

Like this year? Big life events. I’m 30. I bought a house. I got a new job. I kicked out my roommate. I ran a definitely not illegal business selling Pokémon cards. I made my own cryptocurrency. I made two successful 3D prints after failing 150 times. I could go on. 

I’m going on. I bought a $1,500 Herman Miller chair. I was part of a fireworks display that almost engulfed all of Western Montana in flames. I crashed into a bollard picking up some teriyaki noodles and knocked some decorative metal off my car. I started playing golf. I listed a whole bunch of things that made me sound like a pretentious prick in a recap of my year.

Still, even through all of that, I just didn't feel like writing. This year's letter looks a lot different because of that. This was the only way I could think of to actually get me to write it. I used some service to print and mail the cards. Like, today. I did that today. Those cards are out the door. And I kind of want to have something ready for y'all to read once it gets to you.

So, progress.

The good news about this format is that it allows me to be a little more interactive. I can insert a little playlist of the music I'm listening to while I'm writing this. Like this:

Honestly though, it's a bit of a sham. I had a tiny little draft started two weeks ago, and I put that in there then. Right now I'm not listening to anything. I figure if I'm going to lie to you, I should at least let you know about it. 

Back to introspection (if I may): I think the biggest thing is that I always had bigger plans for this year's iteration of the holiday mailer. I am not sure exactly why, but one of the ways my dreams for this letter would manifest would have me presenting some kind of broadcasted stage show.

I'm not sure what my plan was for that. Was I going to do standup? God, I hope not. Some kind of musical number? "Hello, Garden Level? I need to call in some reinforcements to relive my past." It was most likely going to be me, sitting on a stage, just talking to you. But for some reason, it just felt so ~cool~.

Thinking about it now, it was probably the scale of it. The investment of renting a theatre. The sound. The production of it all. I don't think I ever had intentions of creating good content, but rather just felt good about the thought of producing something technologically impressive.

Then Bo Burnham released Inside, and I think I realized that the scope of writing, developing, and producing something like that, and making it something people would actually **want to watch**... well, that basically canned that idea. You can thank him for that on his Instagram, @boburnham.

Emo hours aside, I do have a couple of things to share about this year. Even if my sharing them is only to fulfill a contractual obligation to myself, the least you can do is sit here and enjoy my product.

<hr />

Where to begin, though. Thinking of the long list of things that I told you about, I can imagine there is likely one that sticks out. One thing that you would want to learn more about.

Yes, it's true: [I do have my own cryptocurrency.](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6ffc8d59725b8c618ca1d232e606ab2b9b7bea5e) I am one of two holders, but I hold 99.9% of the tokens. There's a lot you could say about the merits of cryptocurrency. Well, actually, just one thing: if you're lucky, you might make some money.

Everything else is a downside. Sorry in advance, I'm gonna get kind of preachy here, but I wanted to talk about both sides of this because it's equal parts fascinating and terrifying. If you didn't know, the crypto markets are horrible for the environment. Even if you don't consider the environmental toll, the scalability of these systems as a genuine platform for economy is suspect. Fees these days are already astoundingly high, making any transaction a real burn on the wallet. Hopefully more coins follow ETH to proof of stake. But even then, there's a lot of damage being done.

But, I can't deny it: I think the concept is extremely cool. And I wanted to try to put myself in the blockchain. So I did it. Originally, I was going to say that if you wanted some stoopy coin, you could send me some ETH, and I'd toss some your way. But I think that's a little irresponsible. It was a fun project, and it's something I'll forever think is cool. But it's all a big waste. To reconcile with all these ~feelings~, I've paid to offset the environmental impact of all of my wallets. If you participate in blockchain activities, I recommend you do the same, using a service like [Aerial](https://www.aerial.is/).

But really, the point I wanted to make sure was established here: I'm both cooler than you, and a larger menace to the planet. But I'm also self-aware, which makes me a sigma, I think.

The rumors are true: we did almost burn down all of Western Montana. This story is a little hard to tell without the aid of visuals, but I'm going to do my best to tell it.

To set the stage: it's 4th of July. I'm in Montana. I'm surrounded by fireworks, which makes me more than a little bit queasy, having experienced several California wildfires.

It's almost time for my dedicated show. My brother collected some cash from me and got me a "show in a box" called the [Baby Dino](https://www.bestfireworksstores.com/product-page/baby-dino) (authors note: I did not pay that much for Baby Dino).

Right before me, one of the other guys is setting off some mortars. For those unfamiliar with firework terminology, these are those gigantic, enterprise level fireworks that explode into massive designs in the sky. They are loud. They are dangerous. They are loads of fun.

We had gotten to a part of the night where we wanted to string a few of them together, into a timed, mini display of sorts. Honestly, minus the whole "I could die at any second" aspect of it, this was super cool.

But the timing on the last shell was slightly off. Instead of bursting several hundred feet in the air, it burst probably a hundred feet in the air. It was unnerving, but everyone was safe, and it didn't seem to cause any real problem.

Until about a minute later, when we hear the first call out: we had started a fire. The panic that ensued. There aren't words that could properly convey what I felt in that moment. Everyone started running in different directions.

I ran inside. My first thoughts were to either douse it, or smother it. I hadn't seen how big it was, so I thought anything might help. In my head, I had a couple of options. Either bring my filled water bottle out as a first line of defense, or grab the blanket.

I wish that I could have another chance to examine the thought process here. Would that I could, I might not spend 30 of the longest seconds of my life, staring at this faux fur blanket, wondering if it would be a great smother. In the other room, I can hear my brother filling up a giant bucket of water in the bathtub. That is a man with kids. He has a wife. I'm staring at what is obviously kindling, pondering the outcome. He's saving his family, and I'm one move away from burning down all of Montana.

Finally, I come to. Thankfully, even with my extensive brain rot, I am able to deduce that this article may not be the best offensive against the fire that's growing outdoors. I come outside with nothing (you might be screaming at me, but nothing is considerably better than if I had brought the blanket, so I'm still going to chalk it up as a win).

I check on the fire, and I remember thinking, "Oh no, this is already out of control, I should call the fire department."

My brother comes out with his bucket full of water, and tells me to grab the hose. As I do that, volleying — you know what, the rest of this isn't important to tell so dramatically. We get the fire out. All is saved.

This was my first 4th of July at the house on the lake. It was also the first they had ever started a fire. I'll let you know if I'm invited back next year.

<hr />

Today (it's a couple of days later now), I got the email saying that the cards have been mailed out. This kind of puts some pressure on me now. The thing I had all year to prepare for comes down to this final stretch. It's like finals week, all over again.

I spent this afternoon cleaning. One of my newfound passions and timesucks. There are a few things no one tells you about when you buy a house, but how much you're going to accumulate, then clean, then accumulate, then clean is astounding.

Side note, another thing they never mention to you is that they're still going to send you your property tax bill in the mail, even though, 99% of the time, it's handled and taken care of by your escrow (I'm only 40% sure the words I said there made any sense).

The fear that sets in after seeing a $4,000 bill really made me realize I never want to visit a hospital in my life.

Anyway, back to cleaning: today's project involved setting up shelving in my garage to store some of the shit I've accumulated that's occupying space in my house. Some of that accumulation? I filled an entire storage bin with Pokémon cards today.

Yeah, that was all a segue.

Remember the beginning of the year, when you heard all those stories about Pokémon cards being both extremely valuable, and impossible to source? That's supply and demand, baby, look it up.

The story: I got into it. Heavily. I've never been much of a gambler, but for some reason opening up those cards gave me such a rush.

"You mean there's a one in two hundred chance I'll get a card that's worth $1,000 after I spend $200 and wait three months to get it inspected and graded by a reputable authority?"

`This is the part where, upon hearing that proposition, I then proceeded to deposit all of my money`

I wanted to open every pack. I wanted to buy every pack. I wanted every card, so that I could put them in a box in a dark corner of my closet, never to look at them or derive joy from them again.

My friend and I (and to kill two birds with one stone here, yes, he is the same friend who I kicked out of my house later in the year) decided we wanted to start a little side business. He fronted 90% of the cash, we bought a ton of Pokémon cards, and then I broadcasted on Twitch and sold them to viewers.

Here's a clip from one of the streams, in which we opened a "God Pack," from a Japanese set called Shiny Star V, which is about a one in six hundred chance:

My favorite part of that clip, and there's a lot in it, is definitely the exasperated "oh my god," at the very, very end of it. It's almost like I knew in that moment, "wow, I'm way too old to care this much about any one thing in the world."

We registered a legitimate partnership, Riverport Gaming LLC (based in Delaware, because we're both business savants), and had an e-commerce site built on a little known platform called Shopify. We would buy cases of products, and even import boxes and packs from Japan. We had everything.

And it worked. We weren't the only ones in the space. We didn't even charge that much of a premium on the product. But we made a moderate serving of beaucoup bucks. It was a win-win: I got to continue opening cards, AND I even made a little money.

Plus, it's all about the people you meet along the way, with deep coffers of cash reserves burning holes in their pockets. I'm even sending this letter to a couple of our viewers, I think I would call them friends now, who would tune in to buy packs, or just to watch other people get their cards.

Our empire ran from February to August. After I moved in to the house I got a little lazy with it. At the same time, The Pokémon Company was finally catching their printing up to the demand, so online buyers weren't as hungry.

Anyway, the big takeaway here is that I lied earlier. I actually loaded up **three** entire storage bins just with sealed Pokémon product. A relic of a fun business venture. A time capsule for the next major Pokémon boom, in several decades time. In the meantime, if you want anything, visit [rvrprt.com](http://rvrprt.com/). I'll send it to you.

Well, this is getting long. I should probably wrap things up.

This year was very good to me, truthfully. I found a partner who I love very much. I got a new job. I settled in my new home (still working on getting those Montana plates on my vehicle, though). I saw my friends and traveled a bit. I got two doses of the vaccine (at Wal-Mart, lmao), and even got boosted up. I got to go to concerts and sporting events again.

But I'm also thirty. Gross. I hope that never happens to you.

As long as I'm here, I wanted to share some of the things I wanted to accomplish this year. If you're feeling so inclined, I'd love to know some of the things you'd like to do with your 2022 as well. You can leave them as a comment below, or just text them to me. Nevermind, I moved to a new hosting service and there are no comments on this.

* Road trip Norway (if anyone wants to come along, I'm trying to plan a route up the coast hitting cities like Bergen, Ålesund, Geiranger, and Trondheim — hit me up)
* Start learning a new technical skill, like Python or something super ambitious like that (sike, I've already started on this one)
* Run a 5K in a random city or country (let's meet up and do it? — Alex, my forlorn former roommate, is already in)
* Read 13 books (52 way too many, brain rot too heavy)
* Observe a month with minimal or zero waste
* Go back to Red Hot in Tacoma for a veggie dog
* Start the holiday letter earlier in the year so I'm not writing at midnight on December 8th

That's a good enough start. I'll probably use this website to write about them all throughout the year. I don't expect you to bookmark it and come back, because it's not 2007 on the internet anymore. But if you're ever wondering about me, just know that I'll probably be writing here.

And that's it. I hope you're happy. Isn't it weird how that phrase can only be read as scornful? I mean it. **I hope you're happy.** If you're not, or you're missing something this holiday, reach out. Let's chat more.

All my love, and an equal serving of unopened Pokémon cards, 
— stoop
