Do you ever just stop and think about the fact that at any given moment there are literal billions of people doing things. To quantify it a little more concretely, 100% of people are doing things at all times. I don’t know. It’s just something I think about a lot, especially when I am having particular difficulties doing things.

In fact, I very nearly chose not to do this this year. I couldn’t tell you why, other than “I just didn’t feel like it.” But I’ll try to explain it anyway.

It’s like this weird double feeling of “everything happened this year, and I couldn’t possibly condense it into something interesting,” and also “I literally just sat in this spot for a majority of the last year, how could I tell a worthwhile story?”

Like this year? Big life events. I’m 30. I bought a house. I got a new job. I kicked out my roommate. I ran a definitely not illegal business selling Pokémon cards. I made my own cryptocurrency. I made two successful 3D prints after failing 150 times. I could go on. 

I’m going on. I bought a $1,500 Herman Miller chair. I was part of a fireworks display that almost engulfed all of Western Montana in flames. I crashed into a bollard picking up some teriyaki noodles and knocked some decorative metal off my car. I started playing golf. I listed a whole bunch of things that made me sound like a pretentious prick in a recap of my year.

> "Still, even through all of that, I just didn’t feel like writing." — me, seconds from now

Still, even through all of that, I just didn't feel like writing. This year's letter looks a lot different because of that. This was the only way I could think of to actually get me to write it. I used some service to print and mail the cards. Like, today. I did that today. Those cards are out the door. And I kind of want to have something ready for y'all to read once it gets to you.

So, progress.

The good news about this format is that it allows me to be a little more interactive. I can insert a little playlist of the music I'm listening to while I'm writing this. Like this:

Honestly though, it's a bit of a sham. I had a tiny little draft started two weeks ago, and I put that in there then. Right now I'm not listening to anything. I figure if I'm going to lie to you, I should at least let you know about it. 

Back to introspection (if I may): I think the biggest thing is that I always had bigger plans for this year's iteration of the holiday mailer. I am not sure exactly why, but one of the ways my dreams for this letter would manifest would have me presenting some kind of broadcasted stage show.

I'm not sure what my plan was for that. Was I going to do standup? God, I hope not. Some kind of musical number? "Hello, Garden Level? I need to call in some reinforcements to relive my past." It was most likely going to be me, sitting on a stage, just talking to you. But for some reason, it just felt so ~cool~.

Thinking about it now, it was probably the scale of it. The investment of renting a theatre. The sound. The production of it all. I don't think I ever had intentions of creating good content, but rather just felt good about the thought of producing something technologically impressive.

Then Bo Burnham released Inside, and I think I realized that the scope of writing, developing, and producing something like that, and making it something people would actually want to watch... well, that basically canned that idea. You can thank him for that on his Instagram, @boburnham.

Emo hours aside, I do have a couple of things to share about this year. Even if my sharing them is only to fulfill a contractual obligation to myself, the least you can do is sit here and enjoy my product.
