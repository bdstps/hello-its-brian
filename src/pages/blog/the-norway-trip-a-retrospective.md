*Sorry I haven’t written in a few weeks, I’ve been a little busy.*

I came back from ten days in Norway last night. [Remember when I said I was going to Norway?](https://www.helloitsbrian.com/blog/planning-two-norway-trips) I went to Norway.

Aside from a quick three-day jaunt in Berlin back in 2017 before I met up with some friends (incidentally, in Norway) to continue a trip, this was the first time that I had solo traveled alone.

I enjoyed all of it. I have a few regrets, but overall, I feel like I hit all of the things that I really wanted to do. I’ll talk you through all of that.

## the itinerary

The cheapest way to get out there was to fly into and out of Oslo. I always envisioned this being a two city trek, so based on the flights I bought, the structure of the trip would have to go City A, then to City B, then back to City A, where City A is (obviously) Oslo.

I spent a long time deciding between which city, between Ålesund or Tromsø, would be my City B. I think the former is the more beautiful of the two, with its position in the fjords, and mountains all around, but the latter could, potentially, provide a view of the Northern Lights. *Tromsø is also no slouch in the looks department, just so we’re clear.* I ended up choosing Ålesund.

Altogether, my flights cost about $770, but I used my yearly Capital One Venture X Travel Voucher\*\* for $300 off. The plan was to arrive in Oslo on Saturday, March 12th, and spend about two and half days exploring before popping over to Ålesund from the 15th to the 18th. Then back to Oslo to head home.

I think, for as convenient as an open jaw route can be for scheduling (in this case, eliminating the need to return to Oslo), it was kind of lucky that I didn’t try to force it in for this trip. Being in Oslo to end the trip gave me the most access to COVID testing venues, which I would need to visit and procure a negative test from before returning to the US.

By a mistake of my own making* I booked four different hotels. For my first block of time in Oslo, I stayed at the Scandic Grensen ($365 for three nights), right near the Storinget. I splurged a bit on a really nice hotel in Ålesund, and stayed at the Hotel Brosundet ($526 for three nights), owned and operated by an experiences company called 62 Nord. The hotel included breakfast *and* dinner, which is something I’ve never seen before. Back in Oslo, I booked the Thon Terminus ($130) for one night, and the Best Western Plus Oslo Airport ($105) for my last night.

So, in total, for room and board, I spent about $1900 ($1600 with the travel voucher). Not bad. There are obvious places where I could have saved some money, but I wasn’t too focused on creating the most budget friendly vacation. I just wanted something that I would enjoy.

\*\**If you feel like you might be responsible with credit, you can sign up for the Capital One Venture X card, too! If you use my link and make enough qualifying purchases, I’ll get some bonus miles. I think this is probably the best travel card you can get right now, despite its high annual fee of $395. That is almost instantly wiped out, however, when you consider the $300 travel voucher/rebate that’s granted each year (including your first year!), and the instant 10,000 miles (equivalent value: $100) that are awarded each anniversary. I have dozens of credit cards, but this is the one getting all of my spending right now.*

## the sights and the bites

Speaking of enjoying things, while I like to review things and share opinions, I don’t love doing that when travel is involved. I don’t want to be the reason someone tries something or goes somewhere and then have to be responsible for it if they hate it. Movies are one thing, that’s like $12, but a whole vacation? No.

So I’ll just share some quick hits:

* Oslo Opera Tour: I actually did this tour in 2017, but I wanted to do it again. The venue is gorgeous and getting to take a look backstage to see how it all works is fascinating. Someone asked me out after this tour, but I said “no thank you.”
* Oslo Opera Performance: After doing the tour for a second time, I decided to check to see if there were any shows running during the time I was there. As luck would have it, there were. I was able to see the performance of Leoš Janáček’s *Jenůfa.* The content of the show aside, the production was incredible. I paid $50 for a very good seat.
* Munch Museum (Oslo): New museum in Oslo for Edvard Munch. *The Scream* is still in the National Gallery in Oslo, but there are three different variations and prototypes of the famous work on rotating display here. Some interactive bits. Wish the rooftop bar/restaurant had been open.
* Fjellstua Viewpoint (Ålesund): I was expecting to get rain the whole time I was in Ålesund, so when I landed and the sun was out, I made sure to make this the very first thing I did. It’s not too much of a trek, and the 400+ stairs aren’t ever too steep to be extremely tiring. And the view is way, way worth it.
* Cinque Minutti (Ålesund): The last time I traveled internationally before this trip was when I went to Italy in 2019 with my cousin. I’ve also eaten at The Olive Garden. I have very high standards when it comes to pasta. This was some of the best pasta I’ve ever had, and for some reason, it’s in Ålesund. Maybe my expectations were low, maybe I was just overly charmed by the owner who spoke to me, maybe I was riding a sugar high from some of the pastries I bought to go with my meal.
* Molo Brew (Ålesund): There aren’t many brewery options in Ålesund to check out, so I spent a couple of nights trying their stuff. Everything I had was pretty good. And just pretty good. Not excellent. But not offending. Well, the price is a little offensive, but that’s more of a Norway thing than a Molo Brew thing. I liked the Årre Kveike De! Norwegian IPA.
* Brosundet Hotel (Ålesund): I know I mentioned it up there, but this hotel is amazing. Great spreads for breakfast. The dinner options were limited (like I couldn’t eat it any of the nights I was there because it didn’t seem to be vegetarian), and I’m not sure if that’s something they do all the time, but it was nice that it was a legitimate option for many. Beautiful building (it’s a converted warehouse) with a nice room and view of the surrounding street and town.
* Munchies (Oslo): There are a few locations in and around town, but I particularly liked this one near the Munch museum, because it’s designated as Munchies Munch. I didn’t want to be *that American tourist who gets a (beyond) burger on their vacation*, but uh, then I did. It’s good. Honestly, I went twice because I got in to Oslo pretty late after the Ålesund side-quest and needed to eat but couldn’t decide on anything. Sometimes when I can’t decide, I just don’t decide. And I wanted to make sure that I ate something, even if it was boring or a repeat.

There are many, many more things that I did. If I listed them all, you’d hate me. Those are just some quick hits. If you have any specific questions, let me know, and I’ll do my best to answer them.

## the regrets

So I don’t have many regrets about this trip. I think that it was something that I needed, and I’m glad I went and did it, even if I was a little apprehensive about the values and virtues of doing some big and grand excursion as a solo traveler.

I’ll share two.

### time management

I think the biggest regret I have would be working a little harder to manage and make the most of my time.

I didn’t miss any reservations or flights or anything like that, but there were a few moments, especially with the checking into and out of hotels, where I would be kind of stranded for a brief moment in time until my new accommodations are ready for me.

The worst of this was after I landed in Ålesund. I think I landed around 11:30, and my hotel room was not due to be ready for another four hours. Most people, in this situation, would leave their bags with the front desk, and then piss off and explore.

For some reason, my brain feels anxiety about leaving my bags in any situation. I don’t know what their saferoom looks like, who can access it, how they’re supervised, if at all. It’s enough for me to just not consider it an option at all. Unfortunately, in a place like Ålesund, there aren’t many other options for bag storage.

*There’s also this weird feeling I get that kind of snowballs. I wanted to sit down in the lobby originally just to get a sense of things I wanted to do **that day**. I checked some socials, and caught up on things happening in my emails. By the time I had made a plan, I had already been sitting for 45 minutes to an hour. At that point, I feel weird getting up, knowing that I’ve just been sat there. To now go ask for a request just feels weird to me. It’s kind of like the Andy Dwyer meme: I don’t know how long is too long to be sitting here without doing anything, but now I’m too afraid to get up and find out. I also let laziness win a lot of times. Throughout life. Even if I’m actively spending money in an effort to do something that actively fights laziness.*

So I just waited in the lobby. Patiently. I was a bit fatigued from the travel, of course, but I think there are so many ways I could have used that time more effectively to see this city that I’ve just arrived in.

Help me get better at that.

### norwegian skills

The second one (and this definitely will not apply to your trip, should you read this and choose to go to Norway) is that I didn’t learn enough Norwegian before going. I know Norwegian. In fact, unless you are a Norwegian reading this, I am confident in saying that my Norwegian is better than yours. It just is. I can read a lot of things and generally understand what’s going on. I can follow directions, decipher menus and food items, and whatever else you can do with reading. But writing is hard. And listening is harder. And *speaking* is the hardest.

I wish that I had done more practicing. I love learning new languages and love the idea of immersing myself in them, but I have yet to really find myself in a position where I’ve let myself do that. I get very nervous about it. Like the whole range of possibilities: *what if they think I’m an idiot? What if I say something wrong? What if I get part way into a conversation and then get lost in something they’re saying? What if I pronounce a word wrong?*

I found that I would just default to English a little too quickly. I think for the next time that I go, I would like to get to a point where I’m just a little more conversational.

## the next voyage

And that about wraps it up. It was a great trip. It’s no surprise that I love Norway, and I was so happy to finally get back there and hear the language all around me.

Unfortunately, contrary to reports that ran previously on this blog, I will no longer be taking a second trip to Norway this year. Turns out when you realize some gains to buy a house, you owe a lot in taxes. Like a LOT in a taxes. So I’m working on figuring that out before I get back.

But 2023 is looking good. Maybe I’ll hit my 10% of the year goal then. We’ll see.
