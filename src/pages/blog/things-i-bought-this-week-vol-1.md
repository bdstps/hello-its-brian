One of the best parts of earning money is when you get to spend that money. The obvious exception to that statement is when you're spending that money to pay your rent or mortgage, but usually spending money is fun. 

I like to buy things. I also like transparency, whenever possible. I think it's important to talk about the things we do, and share the things we care about. Life is too short to worry about what other people might think about you. Do the things you like to do, and buy the things that you can afford that make you happy. That's how I feel anyway.

This series of posts is eventually intended to tie in with the project I'm working on: yesterday. It's one of the pages linked on my site in a couple of places, and if you've gone to it, you may have noticed that it's looking very empty right now. 

My plans are to eventually use that page, with a little bit of learned coding acumen, to provide auto-populating little vignettes of my days. How much I spent, how much I earned, the sorts of exercise activities I got up to, what I ate... any and all data that I can rip from an API, essentially. 

You might think it's risky, or dangerous to share that much personal information. But I don't think I ever intend to share too much about specifics in terms of exact purchases or exact locations. Plus, I'm kind of an open book. I don't share too often, but when I do, I'll let you look at everything. 

I came up with the idea for this site as an attainable goal for a beginner's first ambitious coding project. Sometime in the next year, I hope to get it implemented fully.

But that's not what this is about, though it does provide a good segue. My first notable purchase was a Mac Mini. It set me back a cool $699.

Truth be told, there was very little thought that went into the purchase of this computer. I certainly don't need it. I've already got a relatively new MacBook, and a very capable desktop gaming rig. For a long time, I had a Mac desktop that I loved. I also love my PC, but there's something about working on a Mac that just feels more comfortable to me. 

I have tried connecting my MacBook to my displays, but the process of mounting and unmounting that setup every time I wanted to use it was just cumbersome enough to warrant the cost of getting something a little more dedicated. I recognize that that's a luxury decision that very few can make and justify, but for me it made sense. 

Especially as I get more into coding and development, I think it will make even more sense to have this dedicated station to work at. At the moment, it's exclusively being used as a work machine for projects related to my coding ambitions and for this website. Everything else, I have my other computers for. 

So far, I'm very happy with it. I got it set up pretty quickly with my keyboard and mouse combo, and it slots right into my main, ultrawide display nicely.

Moving on, as noted in my [last blog](https://www.helloitsbrian.com/blog/my-2021-obsessions), I'm currently on a model airplanes bender of sorts. In the last couple of weeks, I've purchased seven model airplanes, representing some of the different airlines and airframes (models of airplanes) I've flown on. 

This week, I added two more: 

* An **Iberia Airbus A330**, which I flew on the way to Italy in 2019
* An **American Airlines Airbus A319**, which I've flown on more times than I can count

These two models set me back about $87, but I used an Amazon gift card from work to knock down $75 of it. Once they arrive, they will be joining my growing fleet, which already consists of

* A **Finnair Airbus A350**, which I flew on the way back from Italy in 2019
* A **Norwegian Boeing 787**, which I flew on the way to Norway in 2017
* An **Alaska Airlines Embraer 175**, which I've flown on several times
* An **Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-900** in the More to Love livery, which I flew on in 2021
* An **Alaska Airlines de Havilland / Bombardier Q400 (DH8D)** in the retro "meatball" livery, which I flew on in 2021
* A **Delta Airbus A220**, which I've flown on several times
* An **American Airlines MD-80**, which I flew on several times in the early 2010s

I love my little airplanes. I've always loved flying and aviation, but after the first major bout of the pandemic, when I didn't fly at all for well over a year, I've noticed a slight feeling of anxiousness and unease when flying. I'm sure as I continue to fly, when it is safe to do so, things will feel good and exciting again. In the meantime, these little models act as both nice decoration for my office, and a fun way to remember some of the adventures I've been on.

So those are just a few of things that I've been buying. What's something you bought this week?
