One of my goals for 2022 was to read more. More books, specifically. I think it’s interesting how much we discount the vast amounts of reading we do daily online. A lot of it is frivolous reading (a lot of Reddit and baseball trade rumors for me), but there is also a good deal of reading I do online that pertains to self-betterment, and other things like that.

But that’s just so hard to measure, you know. I look at people who are like, “I read 52 books in 2021!” and I’m just like, “well, I read thousands of different threads on Reddit, and hundreds of interesting articles.” For some reason that just doesn’t track as well.

No matter: this year, 2022, I am setting out to read just 12 books. One for each month. I’ve set aside a little bit of time each night to get to that reading, and I do think I’ll blow right past that marker, but it’s a nice starter guideline.

I’ll be using these blog posts as a way to recap some of what I’ve read, and to share the thoughts I’ve had about the book. I may even recommend it, though I’m not too big on making big recommendations. And I would consider being tasked with reading a book to be a decent-size commitment.

The first book of this year was Atomic Habits by James Clear. It’s not a very flashy book, but it’s one that I thought might help me to get in the mindset of creating positive habits and changes that could cause serious impact in my life.

The book is recommended fiercely by many, but the one evangelical who made me want to read it straightaway was [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg) (video embedded). Ali is a former-doctor turned full time productivity/life/tech guru YouTuber. In the last few years, his online empire has grown substantially from a solo enterprise, to a team of over twenty. If you haven’t seen any of his videos, I would recommend giving them a quick peek. If nothing else, his transparency and candor about his process and financial growth are inspiring, or at least they were for me.

## creating atomic habits

Back to the book, its major effort is to instill that habitual thinking and behavior make up a predominant amount of our psyche and routine for any given day. It makes sense, but the numbers to back it up are still a little surprising.

Clear posits that there are four main tenets that make up successful habitual efforts. Habits are born when the process is **obvious**, **attractive**, **easy**, and **satisfying**.

For example, to make a desired outcome **obvious**, you might just remind yourself that you want to do whatever it is you’re trying to force into habit. Writing down an intent statement, with a set time to do the thing and and expectation for how you might do it makes follow-through much more likely.

To make a desired outcome **attractive**, you might pair a difficult task with something more enjoyable, or join some kind of culture or group where that desired trait is “normal.”

To make a desired outcome **easy**, you might consider simplifying the act to its smallest iteration. Instead of getting fit, make your goal putting on running shoes, or being in the gym for five minutes.

And to make a desired outcome **satisfying**, you might use tangible items in the world to track progress or reward yourself (as long as it’s not contradictory to the progress you aim to make).

The book is divided into sections aligned with these tenets, and each one is fairly short, which makes it easily digestible in short reading chunks.

## how i’m applying it

I’m not sure if it’s just excitement from having recently finished this book (this morning, as of my writing this), but I do see some of the ways that I can apply some of this thinking to changes that I want to see in my life.

For those who do not know me or work with me, I struggle a lot with my procrastination. One thing I’ve taken from this book is distilling a desired habit into its least effort-intensive step, and making it my goal to complete just that. It has helped.

Abdaal, the YouTuber I mentioned earlier, recently shared in a video about how he used guidance from this book, and from other sources, to help in the writing of his own book. Everyone has a book. Should I write a book? I already tried once. Anyway, his daily goal is pretty simple (and this is in his words, not mine): “I just need to write 500 crappy words for a crappy first draft of chapter three.”

Getting over the idea of perfection and working to produce *anything* has already been invaluable to how I approach my work. As it pertains to my job, looking at completing, say, a monthly content calendar is daunting, and much more likely to induce stress than shooting to complete just one day’s worth of content.

The hope is that this will snowball into greater progress. You’ve already shown up, you’ve set the process in motion, why stop now? By setting tiny goals, it’s easy to achieve them, and then you’re more likely to overachieve in them.

And, for something less “this goes towards an effort that pays the bills,” I’ve even adopted Abdaal’s 500 word goal into my own habit tracker for purposes related to this blog. I was excited to start writing this earlier today just because I knew that I could check off the box that indicated whether or not I had done it.

Brains are stupid.

## overall thoughts on atomic habits

For as stupid as brains are, that just means they’re easily trainable. Probably. I just made that up.

Obviously, I’m only a few days in, at maximum, from any of the insight in the book being something I could actually apply to my life. Whether or not any of this will stick is hard to measure, and that makes it a little tough to formulate a qualitative review.

I think the early benefits, namely the eagerness I have that I alluded to earlier, are strong enough for me to give praise to the book. Not everything will click for every reader, but I do feel like there are a ton of easy, actionable objectives outlined in this book that can be implemented immediately for personal gain. If you think you are the kind of person who can benefit from heady, mindset shifting narratives like these, then you’ll like this book, and will probably glean something from it. If you’re not that person, you may find it all a bit hokey. And that’s okay!

For as much as I did like it, however, I do feel like it was longer than it needed to be. There were several instances where I felt like the author was repeating information. At only 250 pages, it’s not a huge deal, but you definitely notice it if you’re reading the whole thing within a short window of time.

But I think it can and will help me, so make up your own mind.
