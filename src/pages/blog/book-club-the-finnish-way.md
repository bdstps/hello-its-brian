I’m on a mission to read more books this year than I ever have. By finishing my second book, I have achieved this goal (unconfirmed).

Seriously though, my plan was to read at least twelve books in 2022. One for each month of the year. I anticipate that I will smash through that, but sometimes it’s nice to destroy goals.

Follow along for a recap of what I’ve read. [](https://www.helloitsbrian.com/blog/category/book+club)

## the search for *sisu*

I bought this book for a couple of reasons:

* I’m obsessed with the Nordic style of life
* I thought the cover looked nice

I was super excited to get into reading it, but came out a bit disappointed overall. Its subtitle, *“finding courage, wellness, and happiness through the power of sisu”* kind of led me to believe that the book would be a little more process-based and actionable in its teachings.

While you will come away with a vague understanding of what *sisu* is, and how you might define it, the book is more of an autobiography. It’s all about Katja’s experience moving to Finland and blending into the culture as a foreigner.

On it’s own, that’s not a bad thing. I think the writer is generally a likable person and tells a somewhat interesting story. From my perspective, as someone who once toyed with the idea of moving to Norway, it was easy to picture myself in her shoes and imagine how I might have assimilated myself given the same scenarios.

I think, without that connection, I may not have had enough gas to push through on this one. Where the book breaks down for me, is in its lack of overall substance.

## is *sisu* repetition?

Katja goes to great lengths to uncover the meaning of *sisu*, an innate Finnish feeling or disposition that essentially equates to “grit,” though they never call it such.

Your *sisu* is what gives you the will to continue when things are difficult. Your *sisu* is the push telling you to ride your bike to work instead of taking the car—even if it’s the dead of Finnish winter. Your *sisu* is what compels you to live a minimalistic lifestyle.

Katja regales again and again about the benefits she has personally seen from riding her bike year round. There are plenty of mentions of Finnish people embracing nature and finding joy in taking time to be surrounded in it, whether they’re picking berries, and mushrooms, or going for quick swims in the winter. There are long sections dedicated to how to approach and love a good sauna, and how to be conscious of what you purchase. These, of course, are all mannerisms embedded deep within one’s personal *sisu*.

It makes for a heartwarming story, how moving to Finland and embracing and learning to love her inner *sisu* has freed up tension and resolved deep issues for her. It’s nice to know that it worked out for her, and though the book is tedious at times, I still liked her.

But there’s no meat. This is one person’s story of how they encountered their *sisu* and how it applies in their life. Most chapters do have interviews with Finnish people, people who are friends of Katja’s, and even people who work in academia or higher research. For the most part, these all boil down to the same thing: the person being interviewed has a hard time articulating what is, uniquely, *sisu*. And then when you want more from the interviews and you think you might be getting to it, you’re back in Katja’s personal narrative.

Though the chapters delineate clear natures of the *sisu* there is a tremendous amount of crossover and repetition between them. Nearly every chapter circles back on the benefits of riding a bike. You can’t go more than ten to fifteen pages without hearing again about Finnish foraging culture. This leads to a bit of fatigue, and also a sense of listlessness. Is every chapter about cycling? Sometimes I had to page back in the book just to remember what the central topic for that chapter was.

In all, the whole *sisu* aspect feels a bit forced. The grit or hardiness of one’s *sisu* sounds like a great character trait. Pushing to finish. Getting outdoors even when it’s not the best of conditions. But at some point, there are aspects of culture that are just that: cultural differences and societal expectancies, and not every one has to be related or tied into this concept of *sisu*.

And really, we don’t need to italicize the word *sisu* every time it comes up. For a lot of talk about how Finnish people are on equal standing, whether they’re in the sauna or how they get to work, the elevation of *sisu* through italics gives it this power which, intended or not, presents it as superior to other styles of living. At times it feels very “us vs them” in regards to *sisu* adoption.

## my takeaways from the finnish way

All that said, within the personal narrative, there are some aspects of the Finnish culture and, yes, *sisu* that are appealing and may be worth exploring. Most of all, I found that I just want to experience a good sauna.

Some pieces of advice I’m going to steer away from. Notably, Katja dedicates an entire chapter to “movement as medicine,” which is almost certainly dangerous. I’m pleased that the writer found results with the program and experienced no side-effects, but replacing medication for ailments like depression or anxiety with a brisk winter’s bike ride is likely not the answer for a majority of folks. I wouldn’t recommend making *The Finnish Way* your personal bible for that reason alone.

But aspects of minimizing consumption and building simple, balanced diets that are championed in this book feel like reachable goals.

So is it worth the read? Probably not. Unless you’re obsessed with Scandinavian cultures, or have toyed with the idea of moving to a Nordic land, I don’t think there’s much to gather from reading this that I haven’t already told you.
