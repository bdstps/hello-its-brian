When I wrote the first volume of this series, I kind of envisioned it turning into a weekly thing. Unfortunately (or fortunately, probably) I don’t buy enough things to create that amount of content.

I like the title though, so it’s staying. I’ll just post things when I can.

This first one is thrilling. An absolutely mind-bending purchase.

![A photo of my new suitcases, one small, one large, both blue.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61c1894d76fd1365e7917b5e/18888355-aa5c-41f5-b8ee-4800030478b7/suitcases.png?format=300w)

So, to set the scene: I’m the kind of person who will travel for any length of trip with just a carry-on. My family experienced far too many horror stories with checked baggage growing up for me to feel like risking it every time I fly.

But, with a month long trip planned for later this year, I realize I’m going to have to break that trend pretty soon. The problem is that I don’t even own a bag that could be considered anything other than a carry-on.

The other issue is that my current carry-on bag is on its last legs. I’ve been using it for years, much longer than I ever should have used it, considering it’s some garbage brand I bought at Target back in college.

*I actually just checked, and I can’t find the brand name anywhere on the product.*

It was time for an upgrade. I ended up going with the Samsonite Freeform, mostly because the cost for a set of two vastly undercut the cost of even just one bag from Away, a brand I had been looking at.

There are a lot of purchases that happen in your life where you think, “okay, now I’m adult,” but I think few of them quite match the feeling like the purchase of luggage. I just paid $300 to own two containers that will take up far too much space in my house and remain empty for 90% of the year. Great.

Then there are those purchases that, after the gut check of feeling old and responsible even when it feels stupid, set you back and remind you that you’re still basically a child, deep down in there.

I’m massively obsessed with all things Pokémon. We’ve discussed this before with my Game Boy modding, but I also spent a majority of 2021 selling Pokémon cards on Twitch, and have become fully immersed in the child’s gateway to gambling that is trading cards.

Another thing I am is highly nostalgic. As much as I am keeping up to date with all the latest Pokémon card releases and trends, I was an even bigger consumer of the media when I was just a wee lad. Or, I like to imagine I would have been, had I access to an unlimited pool of wealth, instead of the slow drip of single packs my parents would slowly and methodically release to me.

*Which, of course, I do not fault them for NOW. Their money. I probably wasn’t as understanding as a child. After all, I’m the same kid who, after hearing his grandfather had passed away, his first response was “so anyway, you promised me you’d get me a pack of Pokémon cards after I had to spend all day with our family friend.” Yeah, you guys were out all day seeing off a beloved member of the family, but I’m pretty sure it’s time I get to rip into some Base Set II.*

When, for some reason my parents did decide to get me get packs to open, I never had any luck. I remember my friends who had the really cool holographic Charizard and Gyarados cards, but I just had no pack luck. The only vintage holographic card I am certain I pulled out of a pack was Dark Hypno, from the original Team Rocket set.

Still, those cards have that supreme nostalgia effect on me. I remember wanting them. I remember when I traded for a friend’s Gyarados and all the excitement that followed. That is, until he realized his mistake and told his mom to make me reverse the trade. Damn you, Liam.

No matter how the past went for me, today, I have the money to acquire these cards. So I did.

Over the last several weeks, I’ve been scouring eBay listings, looking for the original set of Pokémon cards. And I bought each of the original sixteen holographic cards. I wanted to be sure I could display them nicely, so I picked out listings of cards that had already been graded.

And now I have a full collection of Base Set Unlimited* Holographics, all graded PSA 7. Is it stupid? Absolutely. Do I love to look at them? Yes, one hundred percent yes.

So if you love it, then it definitely can’t be stupid! No, yeah, it can be and definitely is still very stupid, but thank you for your concern.

\**Unlimited means it was the final print run for that series. The most expensive variation of the original set was the “First Edition” variant. This saw a limited print run, and unopened packs in this variant often sell for upwards of $10,000 each in today’s market. After the “First Edition” print run, there was another short run called “Shadowless,” which is also highly sought after and expensive. Of the three, Unlimited is the most prevalent, and therefore cheapest.*

Those are two major things, but I also bought some of the following smaller things:

* [Mr. Beast’s candy bars](https://feastables.com/) (in the quinoa crunch flavor): I saw them all over the place with some of the creators I follow, and I was intrigued. They’re expensive, but actually really good. Plus the Willy Wonka golden ticket aspect of them is entertaining.
* This [radial kitchen timer that I’m using as a pomodoro timer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M95B91P?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details): Saw it in a [Sara Dietschy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7THEha0ZJJg), and borrowed it for myself. I like the way it looks and so far I’ve actually been able to keep to the pomodoro method, which is nice.
* A new [Bellroy everyday wallet](https://bellroy.com/products/slim-sleeve-wallet/baida_nylon_rfid/charcoal#slide-5) and [travel wallet](https://bellroy.com/products/jet-set/venture/navy-charcoal#slide-0): I’ve been using the same wallet for about 10 years now. I want to start carrying fewer cards, but the elastic in it has worn out, so it can’t quite hold anything other than maximum capacity. On to the next one.
* A [Beacn Mix](https://beacn.com/pages/beacn-mix): Definitely something I didn’t need. My audio setup at my computer is a little confusing, but I think that will help to iron out some of those kinks. At the very least, it’ll be more compact that an existing solution I have, which is worth it.
* Some more books for the Book Club series:

  * *Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day*, by Jake Knapp & John Zeratsky
  * *The Second Mountain*, by David Brooks
  * *I Thought It Was Just Me (But It Isn’t)*, by Brené Brown
  * *The 4-Hour Work Week: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich*, by Tim Ferris
  * *The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness*, by Eric Jorgenson
