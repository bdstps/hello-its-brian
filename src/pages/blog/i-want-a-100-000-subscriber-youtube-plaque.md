I like to think that I’m a person who keeps reasonable goals.

I want to learn how to code. I want to keep consistent updates on a blog. I want to entertain people and enjoy life. I want to travel and see new places ([or just Norway](https://www.helloitsbrian.com/blog/planning-two-norway-trips)).

But for every ten rational, sometimes even simple goals, I have one goal that’s just stupid. It’s usually the case that these goals come and go. I’ll think of them, dream on them for a while, and then I’ll wake up one day not remembering it was something I ever thought about.

As I’ve said previously, [brains are stupid](https://www.helloitsbrian.com/blog/atomic-habits).

But there is one goal that I’ve had for a long time that has stuck around. It’s been around a long enough time that you would think I would have taken action on it by now. But no, I haven’t. After all, I’ve heard the best way to achieve something is by moving imperceptibly slowly towards it.

I’m not going to pretend like you haven’t read the article title: I want one of those special YouTube plaques for reaching 100,000 subscribers.

I also want one for reaching 1,000,000 subscribers, but that seems just a little more out of reach. Also they’re bigger and gold instead of silver, which doesn’t blend with decorations as easily as the 100,000 subscriber plaque. Yes, I’ve thought about this a lot.

## but why would i want one of those plaques?

Obviously, there are a lot of reasons why someone might want something like this.

The biggest reason is that, if you’ve got 100,000 subscribers, you’re probably well on your way to making some kind of a career out of content creation. That may not be the millennial American dream, but from being on TikTok, and from speaking to my nieces and their cousins, I can tell you it’s definitely the Gen Z and Gen Alpha American Dream.

*Also, if you’re like me, you only just realized that the generation after Gen Z is called Gen Alpha. That’s pretty interesting. I’m sure they will be fun once they reach an age old enough to create content on platforms I already feel too old for.*

Anyway, back to it: a career means money, and money from making videos is the freedom from the corporate shackles that everyone craves.

I guess there is a part of me that would want that. But there’s also a part of me that fears that. Have you considered what it would be like to have that many people observing everything you do? Somedays, I wake up and that sounds like the best thing in the world. Other days, I feel like I’m already suffocating under the pressure of an audience I don’t even have.

For me, there are a few reasons why I want one:

* it’s pretty, in my opinion
* I have a lot of empty walls in my house
* it’s something that not a lot of people have

## perhaps you could just buy one?

Yes! Fascinatingly, there exist ways that you can just buy one. As I understand it, if you are the owner of a channel that has surpassed the requisite thresholds to obtain one of these plaques, you can just order more for members of your staff. It’s strictly against the terms of service on YouTube to sell these to the general public, but quick eBay searches would reveal that people do it anyway. They just hide the name of their channel so as not to be prosecuted in the high court of Susan Wojcicki.

And if you’re thinking, “but Mr. Hello, wouldn’t buying one just ruin the prestigious feeling you would get otherwise get from putting in the work and earning one?”

No.

Honestly, I would have bought one already, but I just can’t be sure the plaque wouldn’t arrive with some asinine channel name like xx420SniperKillerCLOUD9xx attached that would make me embarrassed to display it.

Imagine buying a display of achievement that you had no part of, and then not being able to show it off because the name of the channel on the plaque sucks. That would be horrible.

But, though it may be against the terms, there have been known entities who have auctioned them off. And you can bet that I showed up for those auctions. And if you think I’m kidding... here’s a screenshot from a recent Ludwig stream.

Relax.

First of all, I didn’t win it, and I knew that I was going to win it. Secondly, if I had won, the money was all going to charity (No Kid Hungry) anyway. And thirdly, as if this matters in the slightest, I actually do like Ludwig.

*It ended up selling for $32,000. I do not have that kind of cheddar. In addition to other items auctioned off, Ludwig raised over $100,000 for charity. I had to donate $250 (also to charity) to even be able to bid that high. Consider it an idiot tax.*

## i guess i have to earn one instead

So I guess the only other way to do it would be to earn one.

Towards the end of 2020, I was actually talking to one of my cousins, and I mentioned something that really grinds my gears.

If you’ve ever opened even a second of ASMR content on YouTube, you’ve likely been recommended by the algorithm some kind of always-live, white noise ASMR channel. These channels feature extra long videos of rain sounds, thunderstorms, and more, and claim they’ll help you to sleep or relax.

Some of the standalone videos on these channels have upwards of tens of millions of views. The best part: they’ve captivated an audience that will ALWAYS come back to that specific video to help them fall asleep or find a state of relaxation.

There’s a lot of money in that, to be sure, but also LOADS of subscribers. Like, plaque-worthy numbers of subscribers.

And I didn’t think of it first. Me, the guy who paid $5 back in 2016 for lifetime access to a downloadable file of a [recording of the inside of a pressurized airplane cabin](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/cabinNoiseGenerator.php) to listen to while working.

*The funny thing about that is that I’ve never, not even once in my life, done work on an airplane. Unless trying to sleep and failing and ultimately feeling uncomfortable (but excited to be flying) counts as work.*

I told my cousin that I was jealous of these creators. *I* should have been those creators. I would already be looking at my plaque, as I thumb through SD cards, each full with the sounds of chirping birds and flowing streams.

## the bet

He agreed. And so from there, came a bet.

Or really, just more of a challenge. I don’t think there were any stakes. The outcome of failing and continuing to not have a plaque was enough of a potential sting to the legacy.

My cousin and I decided that we would each work towards earning a plaque. He wants one too, but I think that he’s probably more after the monetary aspect of it. Our deadline to do it was by the end of 2023.

We began setting up meetings with each other every Monday night, just to chat about our plans, how things were progressing, and more. It got very serious, and then all of sudden, both of us kind of fell into a new pile of other work.

I got a new job, and he got busy with his [solo enterprise](https://strayvanity.com/). Everything fell to the wayside.

But I think now is the time to bring it back. And not just because I bought a bunch of gear during the original frenzy and ideation phase several months back.

Well, actually, no. It is mostly that.

## my chances to make this happen

Even if I couldn’t pay to win Ludwig’s plaque, I think one will come to me.

Deep within us all, I believe there’s a part of us that feels like we should be famous. And not only that, but it believes that we can be famous, if we just put the right steps in.

Whether that’s something you want or not, there’s a part of us that feels like we deserve attention for the things that we do. We crave it.

It should come as no surprise that whatever part of our brain that is, mine is huge.

So why not just go for it? Whether the end point of this experiment, after however many months or years I find it worthwhile to continue with it, is me making videos for no one, or me creating something out of nothing, it’s not like I’ll have lost anything.

Sure, time. Time *will* be spent. But I’d be archiving parts of my life. That feels valuable.

And that’s why I feel compelled to do it. I know I can. And I know there’s very little to lose.

But also because it’s pretty and I have a lot of walls that need decorating.
