You can’t say I didn’t warn you. I’ve made it abundantly clear that [all I want in life is to have a 100,000 subscriber YouTube plaque](https://www.helloitsbrian.com/blog/100000) to adorn my walls.

This goal could, of course, be finished rather quickly if I allowed myself to get a random plaque off of eBay. But I’m stubborn. I’d rather put in the effort to get one that I know would look good than pay to acquire one that has a stupid channel name on it.

I’m all for flaunting wealth and status—especially when it’s mine—but it’s just not the same fun feeling when you have any reason to be embarrassed by it. And imagine the feeling of waiting for it arrive in the mail. After dropping $700 on this piece of metal that means nothing to at least 75% of the population, and is probably “ugly” in the eyes of just as many, I then have to wait weeks to see if it’s going to be a good channel name.

Life is hard sometimes, you know? These are the kinds of problems that I go through on a daily basis.

## all missions start with small steps

So, like I said originally, I’m going to have to put in the work to get my own.

Yesterday, I uploaded my first full video. It’s based mostly on the content I included in the original post I shared on this blog.

I feel pretty good about it. I think it represents the usual amount of effort I am willing to put into something that is new and exciting to me.

What that means: a lot of touches are really well done and fleshed out. Then some other details are rushed, in a “let’s just get this done” fashion.

Like, the thumbnail is not my best work, but it does accurately display the emotions that Ludwig showed the very moment my bid processed and appeared on screen. And, personally, I believe any time you can look at his face instead of mine is probably a good idea.

But on the other hand, look at all those little graphics I animated to put in it! What a nice touch! That’s my handwriting doing that little jiggly motion. Finally managed to get a little more use out of the Apple Pencil I bought two years ago at the beginning of the pandemic to pen a digital letter to some of my closest friends.

So, all in all: Pretty happy with the product I put out there. Could have been better, but you have to save some room for improvement, you know? You’ve got to show the people that you are capable of making progress.

## working my marketing knowhow

But one thing you’ve got to flex from the beginning is your marketing prowess. Whatever that means. I mean, I am a marketer by trade, but like, do any of us ever know what we’re doing?

*This is the part where everyone else who is a marketer says “yes,” and I say “oh, okay, nevermind I said that then, especially you, current and future employers.”*

Anyway, I have heard that YouTube Shorts are the place to be. In their attempts to keep up with the likes of TikTok and Instagram’s Reels, YouTube started placing a huge emphasis on their own platform of algorithmically curated, shortform, swipe-able, vertical video sometime last year.

Which means I probably should have started this process sometime last year. But maybe if I lean into it now, I can still be one of those “early adopter” types.

I will say that, from a user experience perspective, posting to Shorts is a little weird. Within the desktop interface, there are no special boxes or portals that allow you to upload to the Shorts platform.

Instead, you just have to load up a video that’s sixty seconds or shorter, and then add the #Shorts hashtag to the title. Once you’ve done that, there is a not-so-satisfying amount of zero feedback or confirmation that you’ve actually done what’s right.

So I was kind of in a position where I just had to hope that the tutorials I was reading were accurate. Thankfully, they were.

*Thankfully, those hitches are also helpful to let me know that, yes, this platform is still in its infancy and that focusing on it in any capacity likely makes you a “first mover,” even now.*

My hope is that I can continue to churn out at least of couple of Shorts from every single full-length video that I put out, then supplant that further with some original content recorded directly in-app.

Don’t ask me what that original content will look like, because I don’t know yet. As I said in my first video, “I’m a variety guy.” I’ll just do whatever. This kind of flies in the face of all conventional training of building up a YouTube channel, which is usually to find your very specialized niche and stick to it, but I’ll be fine. I’m different.

## where do we go from here?

As far as a launch goes, I would call this one moderately successful. I put up the content that I wanted to put up.

Now, I just have to keep building. If I’m actually going to stick to, and achieve this goal, I need to be consistent, creative, and some other word that starts with a “c” that precedes good habits.

I’m honestly considering signing up for Ali Abdaal’s ([the guy from the Atomic Habits review](https://www.helloitsbrian.com/blog/atomic-habits)) [Part Time YouTuber Academy](https://academy.aliabdaal.com), but I think paying for that would mostly be paying for the network. In and of itself, not the worst thing, but I feel like I might use my money better somewhere else. I don’t mean this in a way to say it’s not worth the price they charge for it. I’m sure it is. But maybe not for someone at my current stage of production.

I think the most important thing is to just carry on. No matter the results, no matter what happens. Think of content that I can create, sit down, and create it. And then when it seems the most hopeless, keep going.

And then eventually, and sometime before the end of 2023, I’ll have my plaque, and will be able to hang it on my wall and show it to all of you. It will be my prized piece of décor.

But until then, [why don’t you subscribe?](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg-Sgg-1y4h-VT5gSlZXK0g?sub_confirmation=1) Get me a little closer to the goal. Once I get my plaque, feel free to unsubscribe. I’ll understand, I promise.
