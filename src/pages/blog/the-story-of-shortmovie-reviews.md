The year is 2015.

I don’t have a job. I’m working through Human Resources certification classes at San Diego State University in hopes to remedy that. I never get my certificate. I never even finish a second class.

During one of those classes, I find out that tickets for Star Wars: The Force Awakens have gone on sale. I try to buy tickets online. I try to get them, but all the websites are slammed, because at this point in time, people still have youthful excitement about new Star Wars movies. I decide to head to my local theatre to pick up tickets after my class.

My local theatre is newly renovated and under new ownership. It’s my first time back in the building in over a decade. It is a gorgeous place, with great food and beer selections, and big, plushy, reclining seats. I get my advance tickets for the new movie, and notice that The Martian has a showing starting in just a few minutes.

Outside of new Star Wars releases, I wouldn’t consider myself a movie fan. I buy a ticket for The Martian anyway.

For years after that, my weekend mornings were always spent at that theatre. I was obsessed with seeing everything I possibly could. Double booking matinees, I would often get to a point where I had seen *everything* the theatre was showing. I knew when tickets were released, and I almost always was fast enough to book my favorite seat in each theatre. I liked to joke that everyone who worked at the theatre knew me, but that would have necessitated me being social, which I definitely was not.

## burning bright, burning out

Movies became one of my foundational pillars. I had never (and even still have not) seen any of the classics, but I had thoughts on just about every release from 2016 - 2018. I wanted to share those thoughts.

So I started a website: [shortmovie.reviews](https://shortmovie.reviews).

*None of these films compare to Paddington 2, though.*

For a while though, that website was my everything. I put so much money into that website, whether it was buying movie tickets or renting on-demand, or even paying for ad space on Google. I ran so many projections and forecasts to see how long it would take to build a website that I could monetize and shape into something bigger than me.

I wanted to be the best. Not a bad thing, on its own, but it makes the pursuit relentless. Movies became my personality, and watching them was the only thing I cared to do with my free time. Any second not spent in the interest of content was a second wasted.

If you go there now, it’s gone. My fire burned out. And when I wasn’t producing any more content, I decided to stop paying for the upkeep. Some vestiges of it are [preserved through the Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/2019*/shortmovie.reviews), like my favorite movies from respective years, but I didn’t make a personal effort to archive it, so most of it is gone.

And I’ve always been that type of person. I’ll find a new thing, make it a cornerstone of my life, and then one day, I’ll wake up, it won’t enter my mind, and then I’m just done with it.

## why i want to change

I would prefer not to have that same cycle repeat, if I can avoid it.

As for why: one thing that I always come back to, and it’s something that I think many people wouldn’t recognize: it’s embarrassing.

It’s embarrassing to be “the movie guy” within your circle, to suddenly become that person who people recognize as a reliable source to talk to about awards season, or to ask for recommendations, and then just as suddenly become the exact opposite of that person.

For the 2018 Oscars, I watched all 59 films and short films that were nominated for an award. I was interviewed, along with several others, by the New York Times about this chase, though I didn’t make the final article. I remember spending hours over the course of a weekend trying to track down a copy of *Ferdinand* to watch, just because it had been nominated. I drove two hours just to watch a screening of *Loveless*, which I don’t remember a single second of today. I crafted predictions, wrote blog posts talking through which films I expected to take home the hardware. I knew everything about that year’s award cycle.

And I was proud of it. There was no reason not to be. It was and still is a very cool accomplishment.

But then the next year, I didn’t see as many. And I still got questions from friends about movies, and the awards. The year after that: even fewer. Still got questions and conversations. And though those people approached me from a genuine place of interest and a desire to engage with me, my burn out felt like it was on full display, and I always felt embarrassed about my falling out with the hobby.

## but there are positives

It’s easy for me to fall into that, even still to this day. Unfortunately, even if it’s not always “*former* movie critic Brian” I’m thinking of, there are plenty of other examples that I can think of that strike that same chord of embarrassment.

I rarely, if ever, think about the positives.

That website may have been the only reason I got my first real, reputable job. My manager-to-be loved movies, and after listing it on my résumé, we got to talking about it. Even though I hadn’t been updating it much at that time, it was still a substantial body of work that showed some amount of dedication, and demonstrably proved that I could write. Plus, it formed a bond between her and I that may have led to me getting the nod over another candidate.

Plus, the process of going to the movies got me doing something, and looking forward to events at a time in my life when I really had nothing going on. As I mentioned at the top, I didn’t have a job when I first sat, completely alone, in that theatre to watch *The Martian*. Suddenly, I had a new interest that kept me going through a more lonely and emotionally unsatisfying portion of my life.

Even if neither of those things were true, it was another lesson in a class I’m still mastering: how to temper excitement and take things slow. I don’t need to become the best at something to enjoy it. There is value in the journey and the process, even if it takes me longer than anyone else to get there.

I think I’m just an excited person in general, which maybe goes against everything you know about me. I get excited about learning new things, and showing what I’ve learned. I enjoy the process of building something up and putting my stamp on it.

And as I look to start doing that more, whether it’s with this website, or with my desire to learn how to program, or anything else I may pick up, it’s nice to have something like [shortmovie.reviews](http://shortmovie.reviews) to look back on, even if I still feel a little embarrassment about it from time to time.
