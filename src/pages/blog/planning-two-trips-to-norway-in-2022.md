In the last week, I've planned (kind of) and booked two separate, transatlantic trips. Both are heading to the same place.

If you know anything about me, you know that I'm obsessed with Norway. In my very privileged upbringing, I was fortunate enough to visit twice with my parents, once in 2000, and once in 2009. It was after the second trip that I fell in love with the country, its language, and its culture.

Since then, I've been back once in 2017, had plans to go back again in 2020 (unfortunately cancelled due to Coronavirus), and have spent countless hours absorbing as much localized media and material as I can to learn the language.

At one point in time, I had a huge savings account accumulated specifically for the purpose of eventually moving there. I saved over $5,000 for this purpose in 2019 alone, on a salary of $40,000. Granted, I was living with my parents and paid minimal rent, but that still blows my mind that I was able to do that. In total, I saved close to $10,000. My plan was to spend that money to spend the length of a visitor's visa (90 days) in the country, and then use that time to try and get a local job so that I could get a more permanent visa to stay. I estimated that, to be comfortable, I would need to have around $11,500 ready to go. Then, at the end of 2020, I would take the plunge and go.

Obviously, given the time that I was planning to make all of this happen, a lot of other factors would have inhibited my departure. Ultimately, as time went on, I realized that my particular skillset (aka: not STEM) would be hard to find a job with, and I became a little disenchanted with the prospects of that journey being worth it. A lot of that money eventually went towards my move within the states back in 2020, and helped to secure a little bit of the down payment I needed for my house.

Since then, it’s been impossible to get back, due to the pandemic. Norway, smartly, was one of the few European countries that refused to open back up to non-Schengen tourism, and held that stance through most of 2021. It was something I monitored pretty closely, just because I was itching to get back. I’ve actually been a bit surprised by the fact that, as things continue to get worse with Omicron, they’ve still kept the gates open.

So naturally, with borders open once again, I was quick to get something booked. There was never going to be another choice for my first international vacation following the pandemic outbreak. In fact, my love of Norway has become something of an impedance to me wanting to explore new places. Whenever I think about traveling now, my first thought is always wondering how I can fit Norway in. Even before the pandemic, when I visited Italy with a cousin, I spent a few nights planning ways that him and I could pop up there, even for just a day. I just love it so much. I *could* go new places, and see new sights, but I'm always most concerned with when I will get back to my favorite place.

Anyway, without saying too much about when I plan to be there (I have to keep my home stateside safe, you know), after a night of feverishly checking destinations and flight prices, I've finally found the dates for that long awaited return. And I liked it so much I booked it twice: one short trip in the first half of the year, and one long trip in the second half of the year.

The shorter trip was booked with cash, through the Capital One travel portal. The roundtrip price was around $620 from a near-ish major metro to me. I’m a [Capital One Venture X card holder](https://myaccounts.capitalone.com/Card/Jv%252FOW9sAa4WVjfP62jYQHtBuzZumx1l9BmL1YkoVt74=/offers/referrals) (that’s a referral link — I’ll get 25,000 bonus miles if you use it and get the card — but I do believe it offers the best bang for the buck for travel rewards if you can hit the $10,000 minimum spend in half a year), so I automatically get $300 in cash back on travel per year, when booked through their travel portal. That essentially made up the cost of my flight to and from the metro area I’ll be departing from. The second trip was booked with 60,000 Alaska Airlines miles, again through that same major metro.

Both trips will have me flying into and out of Oslo, but I’m not sure how much time I’m likely to spend there on either voyage. I’d like to see a performance at the Opera hall, and check out the newer Munch museum, but other than that, there’s not a ton that I need to see there that I haven’t already. The good news is that, in my researching, I’ve found that it’s fairly inexpensive to get almost anywhere in Norway, by plane, from Oslo. So, there’s not too much that’s off limits to me in the time that I will be there.

## so where am i going?

During the first, shorter trip, I’ll likely only have time to check out one other city besides Oslo, and at present it’s looking like it will be either Ålesund (pictured) or Tromsø. These are both cities I’ve been to before, but neither for more than a single day.

When I have more time, on the second trip, I plan to make my way out to more of the extremities of the country. Places like Alta and Longyearbyen in the north (and even more north), have always caught my eye, but previously seemed unreachable. Then I found out a one way ticket to both places was only $45, and generally takes less than around two hours.

This means that nothing is out of reach, whether it’s places like the ones listed above, some of the more popular destinations like Bodø and Lofoten, or just random places that I have some attachment to, like Åkrehamn, Steinkjer, and Finnsnes*. Overall, I’m planning on spending over 10% of my 2022 in Norway, so my feeling is that if I want to see it, I’ll probably have time for it. And if that ends up not being the case, well, I guess I’ve just got to come back.

I’ll be sharing updates on itineraries and trips as they come to light. I will never share dates or live updates, but will provide lots of fun content, visual and written, once I return from my journeys.

\**Okay, so it’s a long story, but back in 2017 I made a fictional Norwegian baseball league in a game called Out of the Park baseball. Teams were placed randomly, but I gave them each unique named (in Norwegian), and designed logos and uniforms for them based on existing or historic city crests and emblems. These are three of those cities. Also, as the Bergen Blader General Manager, I won 11 Titles in 26 years.*
