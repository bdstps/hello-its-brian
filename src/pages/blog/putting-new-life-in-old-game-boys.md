I’m not going to lie to you: I like spending money.

One of my more recent, momentary obsessions was collecting the old Pokémon video games. In many cases, these were games that I had previously owned, but eventually traded away, probably in high school in hopes of making the latest iteration of Call of Duty more attainable, price-wise.

After buying a handful of these old games, I realized that the original, intended hardware for playing them was often a bit underwhelming. Screens without a backlight that you can’t see unless you’re in the most perfect environment. Old, beat up hardware from over a decade of abuse.

It’s not ideal. But you can make it better.

## making the perfect console

With a little bit of research, you’ll find that there’s a huge market for after-market upgrades for basically every Game Boy ever produced.

Want a larger, brighter screen? You can do that. Want to replace the plastic shell with a perfect reproduction in any color you want? You can do that, too. Want to say goodbye to AA and AAA batteries forever, and charge your Game Boy with USB-C. Yup, that too.

Suddenly the part of my brain that loves spending money started firing. “I need to do this.”

I did it. I ordered a bunch of parts for three different Game Boy models, and then sat, saddled with the realization that I also needed a soldering iron and knowledge of how to use said soldering iron.

So I also ordered a soldering iron. I knew that my dad could solder, so how hard could it be? *Don’t read that like I think my dad is an idiot, because he’s not. I just mean it can’t be THAT specialized.* I figured I had watched enough YouTube videos of people restoring and fixing old electronics that the skill would come pretty naturally.

*I don’t want to spend too much time on the “I learned how to solder” part of this blog, but just know that it is kind of easy, but also that I genuinely have no idea how it works and constantly felt like I was doing it wrong.*

## struggling out the gate

Getting started was stressfu—and I broke a Game Boy Pocket.

Well, maybe that’s not fair to say. It’s hard for things to be completely broken beyond repairability when soldering. If there’s one thing I learned, it’s that it’s a very reversible process. But with my limited knowledge of how things work, as soon as it doesn’t boot up anymore, it may as well be completely dead.

The good news is that I was able to complete mods on the two other models: one a Game Boy Advance, and one a Game Boy Advance SP. You can see a photo of the former below.

The process for the SP model was kind of tough. Specifically, with the hinges, it’s a bit challenging to get the ribbon cable that connects the screen (in the top half of the clamshell), to the motherboard (in the bottom half of the clamshell) looped and through the designed holes in the plastic. Even in the mod I completed, my ribbon cable is a bit pinched.

But the regular Game Boy Advance? That thing is easy. Drop a new screen in, solder six points, close the shell, put in the battery. Done. There are no tight squeezes, no body modifications that need to be done. It’s just simple the whole way through.

## time to monetize

I’m not going to lie to you: I like making money.

I’m always looking for new ways to make a little bit of extra cash on the side. It’s fun to think about all the ways that I could develop income streams.

And after making that Game Boy Advance, I wondered how easy it might be to make that modification a vehicle for income. The process was simple enough, and based on cursory eBay searches, there was enough of an interest to think I could sell a couple per week.

Throwing all caution to the wind, I immediately loaded up my cart with the parts to make modifications on 10 more Game Boy Advances. They would all be exactly the same: same shell color, same screen, same everything. Over the next couple days, I staked out eBay, both to research competitors selling modified systems, and to find donor systems to use for my modified systems.

Overall, the cost of everything (Game Boys, screens, shells, buttons, etc.) came out to $1599.84. And just like that, I was off.

I built out a little profit estimator in Excel, and got to work doing all the mods. Being a little bit rusty, the first one took about an hour. The second one was closer to forty minutes. By the time I finished my first day of modding, I was getting them in and out within twenty minutes. Despite that, each one looked even better and more polished than the last.

## what you don’t account for

I spent a lot of time looking at that price chart. I planned to sell them for $225 each, which seemed like a steal compared to some of the other sellers on the platform. At that price, I was due to rake in around $600 in profit.

Not bad. Even with a conservative thirty minute turnaround time, that’s $120 an hour.

But then you remember eBay seller fees. And then, when you notice your item isn’t getting any traffic, you opt to list it as a promoted listing, which eBay takes a further cut from. And then you realize no one trusts you because your eBay seller rating is too low, so you lower the price $10 to sweeten the pot. After all that, it still takes three months to sell the 10 Game Boys you listed. *You’re still making money, it’s fine.*

And then there are the really unexpected things. I actually ended up ordering 11 Game Boy Advances. One of them got lost in the mail on the way to me. It was supposed to arrive on Halloween. I’m still working with the seller and USPS to try and get my money back for that one.

This isn’t going to end with me saying “*I actually lost money,*” because I didn’t. But it’s amazing how fast things like that can start appearing and eating into your profit. Then, when you factor in the sporadic trips out to the post office, dealing with postage and packing, the little amount of money you made almost doesn’t seem worth it.

Still, I almost did it again. I loaded up another cart full of replacement screens, shells, and buttons, and was committed to hitting the buy button. But in those three months between my first batch and that moment, everything got more expensive. I could raise the price on my listing, of course, but I didn’t know if I had the fortitude to put that much skin in the game and wait for the profit again.

## the end of an empire

And so my days as an eBay seller ended. 10 sales. Positive reviews all around.

A lot of fun making the consoles. A lot of headache in all the rest. There’s definitely money in there, were I to continue with it. At the same time, I felt bad swooping under some of the more established sellers in that space. I also wonder how much longer I could do the mods before burning out on such monotonous work. All that said, I’m content to leave it as one chapter in my life.

Out of all of this, the good news is that I probably know how to solder now. Jury’s still out.

If you want a custom Game Boy Advance, and I know you personally, talk to me about it. I would be willing to make one offs for people who are cool. Email me to talk about costs.
