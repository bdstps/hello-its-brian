In 2022, I am aiming to read 12 books. It’s a very attainable goal, but I did it that way on purpose. Throughout the year, I’ll be sharing my thoughts on the books I’ve read here. So far, some of them have already left me with morsels that I have applied to how I think and perceive.

This book is probably not going to provide the same kind of learning opportunity. *The New One* is my third book, which means we’re still well ahead of schedule.

## from stage to page

I love Mike Birbiglia. I want to make that abundantly clear. This book kind of made me hate him. I still love him, but there were definitely parts of reading these stories that made me disappointed and upset with him.

If you’re unfamiliar with Mike Birbiglia, he’s a comedian. If you’ve never seen his stand-up work, you may have seen his other works, like *Sleepwalk With Me* and *Don’t Think Twice*, films he wrote and directed, as well as starred in.

In 2017, I had the chance to see Mike perform his latest stand-up show in San Diego. It was called *The New One,* and was basically the entire content of this book. I loved the show when I saw it, and when it was eventually released on Netflix, I watched it again. I loved it then, too.

So. To review here:

* I love Mike Birbiglia
* I love *The New One*, the stage show
* I love *The New One,* the Netflix special (because it is the stage show)
* I did not love *The New One,* the book

But why?

I think a lot of it has to do with the form of media. It’s not that it’s a book, because I like books! I’ve read three of them. But consuming this specific piece of entertainment in this form has a way of languishing that the others don’t.

## damage over time

*The New One* details a first time father’s struggle with fatherhood. Neither Birbiglia nor his wife, Jen, expected or wanted to have a child. But then feelings changed. After much debate, and promises that their lives would stay the same, they had one anyway.

Throughout the stories, whether performed on stage, or presented on the page, we hear Birbiglia’s inner monologue, lamenting the fact that their lives did not, in fact, stay the same. As his wife cares for their child, in a way that only a mother can, he begins to feel like an outcast in his own family.

Some of this, you can tell, is played up for the laughs. But within the confines of an hour-long special, things move a lot more quickly. There is just not enough time for him to fully articulate the loneliness and uselessness he felt in trying and failing to be “a decent dad.”

With the book, you end up spending less time enveloped in his humor and his delivery, awaiting the next jab of a punchline, and more time thinking, “wait, that’s actually kind of shitty.” Over the course of several nights, as you continue to sit with this book and make your way through it, you start to take note of those feelings. Even now, after finishing the book, I can only recall Birbiglia lamenting the negatives about the birth and existence of his child.

And as he continues to go on, I started to form this sense of resentment for him. He may not have been able to help in all the ways a mother can, but he could have sent the email. He could have set up the car seat. He could have done so many things that he simply did not.

And that makes me hate him, a little.

## a collaborative effort

But I should probably talk about the bits that I do like.

One of the beautiful aspects of this book is the realization shared by both Mike and his wife that they had been separately penning introspective and reflective works following the birth of their child.

The product for Mike, obviously, was the hour of comedy this book draws from. Meanwhile, Jen toiled away on snippets of poetry.

These poems found their way into the book, littered throughout the pages. And while some of them aren’t at all my cup of tea, there are plenty that are really special and heartfelt. As an added bonus, they kind of serve as a nice little remedy to the distaste Mike’s sometimes inaction had left in my mouth. Like, “oh, okay, she doesn’t totally resent him, it’s fine.”

On their own, I wouldn’t consider the poetry reason enough to sell the book, but it’s an at times nice addition, especially when I’m reading stories I’ve mostly heard before.

## the giggles

Through all that, and despite knowing the source material pretty thoroughly, Mike still delivered plenty of humorous and laughable moments throughout this book.

*As an aside, I had a weird moment reading this where I thought “it’s weird to laugh while reading,” as if that shouldn’t be possible. All the while, that has been a primary goal of some of my own writing, including my annual holiday letter. Maybe I thought that only I can be funny. Which, honestly, true.*

That said, not all of it landed quite the way I expected it to. There’s a direct line you can draw from performance to prose in this content, but some of it probably would have fared a little better with some altering for the page. Something in the disconnect between his intended delivery and the way that I read it in my head made some jokes a little flat.

## in review, and where i get slightly parasocial

In some ways, it’s weird because I don’t really know how to feel about this book. Parts of it are beautiful and hilarious and ripped straight out a piece of media and art that I absolutely adore. Parts of it shed new light on a person who, within the confines of an hour felt misunderstood, and unwanted, but when fully fleshed out, appears to be a little more on the unhelpful side, if not apathetic.

Reading it was enjoyable, and frustrating. You want to root for him and for him to feel the connection to a child a present father deserves. But sometimes you feel like he might not deserve that.

Content like this is a tell-all, and it’s another chance to peer behind the curtain into the life of someone you respect and admire. Over the last several years, especially, I’ve learned that this deeper glimpse doesn’t always leave you with the fondest of feelings. Sometimes, you’re left with a sour taste in your mouth. It’s better to not get wrapped up in the drama, but when they’re showing it to you, it’s hard not to.

So, it’s tough. It’s hard to know how to separate the inflated bits, and to identify where the real Mike Birbiglia begins and ends. If you are new to Mike and his work, it’s definitely hard to recommend this book as a starting point.

But I’d still recommend Mike Birbiglia, the performer.

If that makes sense.
