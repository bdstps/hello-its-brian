For all the ways that I am put together, there are so many more ways that I absolutely am not.

One of the things that has always bothered me the most about myself is my tendency to procrastinate. Tasks pile up, and sometimes I end up forgetting the things I want to accomplish, and whether or not someone is expecting a response from me. It’s a mental block that I’ve always had, going back to my school days.

I actually still have recurring dreams where I’ll show up to a class on finals day, and have to take a test without ever having done any work previously. Or, worse yet, I’ll realize midway through the semester that there’s a class on my transcript that I didn’t even know about. Feeling the limited amount of time left, and the weight of the work I need to do to catch back up is maybe one of the worst feelings.

And then I wake up and everything’s fine.

I’ve tried so many things throughout the years to try to put a stop to this kind of behavior. I do always eventually get everything done that needs to get done, but sometimes the pressure and crunch to get it to that point can feel temporarily immobilizing.

I’d like to curtail that as much as I can. Lately, I’ve been turning to Notion as a place to organize, well, everything.

## in case you haven’t heard of notion, i’m about to tell you what it is

If you’ve been living under a rock like I seemingly have, I’m going to do my best to describe what Notion is. But this is a really difficult task, because I’m honestly not sure what Notion can’t do.

*That sounds like an ad. I wish I was paid by Notion, but I’m not sure how much interest they would have in sponsoring a post on a blog with three irregular readers. Probably not helped much by the video embed just below, but I figure if I’m terrible at explaining it, they might do it a little more justice.*

Within Notion, you can set up individual pages and databases where you can organize notes, thoughts, website clippings, and more.

Whether you’re working on a project solo or part of a team, Notion brings it all together, and makes it easy to get your feet moving on anything, no matter where you are.

It’s really satisfying to be able to open the app, check off a progress box, and then come back to my computer later and have continuity. Normally, I wouldn’t rave too much about this feature, but too often that’s something you have to pay for.

*I don’t fault developers for this, wholly. I think a lot of the blame lies on App storefronts that likely put a ranking premium on their ability to drive recurring revenue. Without a subscription model of some kind, I assume (ie: I have not done the research) that the app would not be as discoverable. Not to say that there aren’t scummy SaaS App Dealers and practices out there, because there certainly are, but that’s a topic for another time.*

With Notion, it’s all free. There are paid tiers that scale up as you add more team members, but for a solo operation, in my specific use case, it is completely free.

## crowdsourced planning

The best part about Notion, bar none, is the ability to share and use templates with other users.

For me, when I first downloaded the program, I had that “stuck” feeling. Everything the app showed me as a tutorial was overwhelming, and I couldn’t see ways that it could fit into the applications that I envisioned using it for.

**I actually deleted the app**.

I was so overwhelmed that I didn’t think it would be worth it to move everything over from the various other systems I had been using. Then I saw someone’s TikTok about how they use Notion to track their habits.

*Man, that TikTok algorithm is good, isn’t it?*

After watching this video, I went to try the app again. The first thing I did was delete all of the provided content. For some, this kind of content may be beneficial to acclimatize and start to understand the program. But as we’ve already established, it just felt a little boxed in when I looked at it.

Once I felt well and truly cleansed, I downloaded a template like the one I saw and modified it slightly to fit my needs. It was everything that I had been wanting in a digital, cloud-based habit tracker.

That was my “aha!” moment. From that point on, I was officially on the hunt for more creator content, documenting how they use Notion to organize their lives.

## how notion has organized my work

After adopting some other user generated templates into my Notion, I completed my full reversal from originally deleting the app. Now I’m in the app throughout most of the day.

My favorite part is how easily the data presentation can be modified. Viewed through one filter, my work looks like a folder of content with due dates and tags. With a click of a button, I’m suddenly in a Trello or Asana, where I can choose to show my content as a calendar, or a kanban board. Some of these views are premium features in other task management apps, but still free within Notion.

And once I started to get the hang of it, the wheels starting churning. At once, my mindset shifted from “this could be a useful thing,” to “I need to find a way to integrate everything I do into this system.”

I haven’t gone quite that far yet.

But, in addition to managing all of my blog content and working on habit-tracking, I’ve also got pages and databases dedicated to the things that I am reading, meal prep and planning, trip itineraries and cost breakdowns, and reference notes for my foray into programming.

It’s like all the ways that I previously used Google Sheets, except a little less cumbersome. And wrapped in a prettier package.

*Plus, if I ever wanted to add someone else to my workspace in Notion, the process is a bit simpler than managing permissions on several different Google Folders and sub-folders.*

And the best part: I’m actually getting more work done. I’m getting things done when I want to get them done, sometimes even ahead of schedule. That’s never really happened for me before.

Now it’s just time to see how long it lasts.
