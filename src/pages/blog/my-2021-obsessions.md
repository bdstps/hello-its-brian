Ever since I started scrolling through TikToks a couple of years ago, I’ve come to realize a few things:

1. Brain rot is real, and I probably have it
2. We are all part of a shared collective that has the same thoughts, experiences, and especially tendencies

Now I’m not one to call the proverbial “I thought *I* was the *only one* who did that!” wolf so nilly-willy, but the amount of times I’ve genuinely thought that after watching someone else’s video has been nothing short of remarkable.

I never said it was *super* remarkable. Just kind of remarkable.

Anyway, it being the end of the year, new trends and sounds are popping up to share the highlights (and sometimes lowlights) a person may have experienced.

An interesting one that I’ve seen a lot already this year looks a lot like the video embedded to the right.

Accompanied by a sound that mashes utterances of month names in songs together into one flowing calendar (*notably missing August by Taylor Swift*), the user shares the things they hyper-fixated on in each month.

Some, like the video shown, will share things in the pop-culture sphere, the various TV shows, music, movies and interconnected worlds they fell into and couldn’t find a way out of.

Others have taken it a different way, sharing the meals and items of food that became sources of comfort or nightly staples.

I don’t think I’ve ever thought that I *didn’t* have a hyper-fixation problem (if you could even call it that), but seeing everyone share their hobbies and half-baked passions that were picked up with a fervor and subsequently dropped by the wayside made me realize just how much I’ve done it too.

In fact, in even taking a singular moment to go through it, it’s easy to outline my year in the places where I’ve hopped on and off different trains of thought and vehicles of interest.

I think there may be no way more fitting to recap a year than to go through it all. To see what I cared deeply about throughout the year, which fires burned the brightest, and what (if anything) I’ll carry over into another year.

## january & february

* pokémon cards (collecting)
* noodles & co.

I lumped January and February together because they were almost the same.

This was the beginning of my Pokémon craze, starting with personal collecting for the first time since I was a mere child, and eventually culminating with me selling packs of cards to people online.

And if I can say one word about Noodles & Co.: their macaroni and cheese is just good.

## march

my ownership in burrito

* pokémon cards (selling)
* crumbl cookies
* cryptocurrencies and NFTs

Something switched in March, and suddenly I just wanted to make more money.

I knew people had been selling Pokémon cards on Twitch, so I started doing it too. Together with a friend, we registered a legal business entity, and started our business selling and opening packs to a live audience. This would go on until about September, but I was the most excited about it from spring to early summer.

And then I saw people making money buying and selling NFTs. I wouldn’t personally make an investment in any NFTs until around August, but I was still following the scene heavily. I made my biggest splash on the platform [Bitclout](https://bitclout.com), which aimed to directly monetize user accounts through a sort of “paid shares” model. Notably, I invested $20 in an account entitled @burrito.

## april & may

* shopping around for a house
* domino’s pizza
* cryptocurrencies & NFTs (may)

In April, I realized I could realistically afford to purchase a house. I’ll eventually go into financials and information in a post down the road, just because I think transparency is important, but this is when that switch flipped and I really started considering it.

Basically, my roommate was skipping town for a new job, and I wanted to stay but didn’t want to rent any more. I liked the idea of being able to have a place that I could change and mold to my liking, and felt like a lot of the rental options here weren’t THAT much cheaper from what I was used to back at home in California.

So, house. Those daily Zillow emails were annoying, and I was so glad to be finally be done with them. I ended up putting offers in on three homes.

The best news for me is that my new house was *not* within the delivery zone for my closest Domino’s. As of the writing of this post, it still isn’t. So this was a short lived obsession.

## june

* home furnishings and home tech
* bo burnham’s *inside*
* pizza hut

Bet you didn’t see that one coming. Ended my friendship with Domino’s, now Pizza Hut is my best friend. It’s not nearly as good, but to not leave my house, it’s worth it.

But the amount of money I spent on pizza (thankfully) pales in comparison to what to I spent on furniture and home automation tech. After getting the keys to my place, I IMMEDIATELY went to best buy to get a new doorbell, a new thermostat, new smart speakers & displays, new light switches, and more.

And that’s after I already spent a boatload on getting a new desk, new bed, new mattress, and other furnishings to go with it.

June was an expensive month, and I loved it but I would also like to never go back.

## july & august & september

* golfing
* teriyaki tofu noodles
* NFTs (august & september)

No seriously, it was almost exclusively golfing.

I hadn’t golfed in years, but when my dad came out around Father’s Day, my brother and I took him golfing. What followed was an abundance of some of the worst playing you could possibly imagine.

I think I sent texts to my dad on like, eight different occasions, telling him I had “found my swing.” If I may: I never found my swing. The most notable occurrence of this was at a Top Golf in Phoenix during a friend’s Bachelor’s Party.

I bought some clubs and waited AGES for them to show up, and the good news is that they arrived just in time for me to play with them once before the end of the viable golfing season.

I do think this is one of the hobbies that will persist into the new year, but I definitely don’t think I’ll ever be good at it.

I also bought some NFTs. The only one that has made me even a shred of money was my ENS domain (stoops.eth). I bought it early enough to be eligible for the airdrop.

## october & november

* modding old game systems
* teriyaki tofu noodles
* virtual reality gaming
* 3D printing
* wanting to go to Disneyland every day

I saw some tweet recently that said “everyone has that friend who bought a VR headset, raved about it for two weeks, and then never mentioned it again.”

Hello, it’s me.

I also got back to Disneyland for the first time since the pandemic started, spending two days there with my partner. Even after moving away from California, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to shake the absolute stranglehold that colossal moneysink that park will always have on me. As soon as I leave the park, I just want to go back. Instantly. We spent something close to $2000 on the hotel stay, park tickets, and all that, and I’m already wondering when we’re going back.

I figured I would need something to line my pockets to be able to afford *that*, so I bought a soldering kit and started modding old video game consoles. After making modifications to one Gameboy Advance for myself, I jumped right in and bought kits and systems to do TEN MORE, which I would eventually sell on eBay.

I’ve sold three so far.

## december

* model airplanes
* teriyaki tofu noodles
* this website
* 3D printing
* thinking I need a Husky tool drawer in my office

How would I even get a Husky tool drawer into my office? Not sure. I think the embarrassment from having to get people to move it up there is enough of a deterrent to ensure that it never happens, fortunately.

And please don’t make fun of me for the model airplane thing. I just really like them. And I thought it would be cool to have a model commemorating all of my favorite airframes that I’ve flown. I ordered seven of these models. I’m not sure how I plan to display them once they all arrive, but I can imagine some kind of gallery wall would look cool.

Finally, I spent a lot of time on this website, which was originally on Wordpress because the plan was cheap, but is now on Squarespace because it looks nicer. I’m vain. I wrote out my Christmas card (sorry, that’s private), built out the whole site, and have been brainstorming ideas on how to make this something worth visiting and reading.

And that’s kind of it. I’m curious to know what your hyper-fixations were this year, or currently! It was comforting to know that I was not alone in my penchant to hop from thing to thing, so hopefully this can bring you a little solace if you’re in the same boat. And then in a different boat.

Let me know in the comments if you’ve been focused on anything recently.
